This site was made for a friend who was running the joke that she was running for president against Donald Trump and Sleepy Joe Biden. 
The original version was just a hyperlink that said that you voted. When v1 was released, we added some buttons, submit screen, contact form, and more to the site for added functionality.
There are a couple of CSS files, but its mainly HTML as that is the only language that is website related that I know. I only know HTML, not CSS, and some JS.
Eventually I will get some CSS in there making the site look good but until then you just have what it is now.
